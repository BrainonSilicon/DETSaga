# About The Project

Saga is a "Choose Your Own Adventure" storybook that reads itself to you. 

## Project Pitch
Getting your children to bed can be a long process, and sometimes the “just one more story” lasts forever...

Introducing Saga the ultimate bedtime storyteller. Bedtime stories are important for both childrens’ literacy and language development, and their moral development; it’s how we’ve passed on knowledge since the beginning of time. Saga is for the “just one more story”, for the nights when you can’t get home from the office. It’s not just another bedtime story, Saga is a world your kids can explore. It gets kids involved in stories and books through it’s master storyteller’s choose-your-own-adventure stories. Saga doesn’t just read the story to the child, it makes them the story teller, allowing the child to choose what the character should do next with both small decisions to increase their vocabulary, and large ones that have moral lessons attached to them.
